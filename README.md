# jQuery Easing Plugin

What is it? More info [here](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing)

For cdn please use cloudflare [`http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.min.js`](http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.min.js) to help my host. Thank you.

If you're coming here because of a popup on your site I'm sorry, but the increased [hotlinking](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking) has caused me issues with my hosting company so I'm taking steps to try and sort it out. Please update any links pointing to `gsgd.co.uk` to use your own server or you could try using the above url for CDN (though this currently only has the 1.3 easing script, look at http://cdnjs.com/ for more info and maybe try and add any missing files/versions still in use).

Please also note, I have no problem with anyone's use of the plugin without my knowledge or permission, it's just the [hotlinking](http://altlab.com/hotlinking.html) that's causing me a headache. If you email me at hotlinking@gsgd.co.uk I'm happy to try and exclude your website while you sort this out though I can't guarantee how long it'll take me to get through all the requests.

Many thanks    
George
